# Big-mart-sales-preddiction
 Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to compare various machine learning models to find the best one for predicting sales at Big Mart outlets. The project involves:

Data Preparation: Handling and cleaning the dataset, which includes sales information, product attributes, and store details.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
Model Comparison: Training different models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) and comparing their performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Objective: Selecting the best model for predicting future sales accurately.
